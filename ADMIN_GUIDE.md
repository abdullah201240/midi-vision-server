# Admin & Role-Based Access Control Documentation

## Overview
The system now supports two user roles: **User** and **Admin** with role-based access control (RBAC).

## Roles

### 1. **User** (Default Role)
- Can register and login
- Can view their own profile
- Can update their own profile
- Can view all medicines
- Can view single medicine details
- **Cannot** create/edit/delete medicines
- **Cannot** view all users
- **Cannot** delete users

### 2. **Admin** (Privileged Role)
- All permissions of regular users
- **Can create medicines** (with images)
- **Can edit medicines** (update info, add/remove images)
- **Can delete medicines**
- **Can view all users**
- **Can delete users**
- Full system access

## Admin Credentials

### Default Admin Account
After running the admin seed script:

```
Email: admin@midivision.com
Password: Admin@123
Role: admin
```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Run Migrations
First, apply the database migrations to add the role field:

```bash
npm run migration:run
```

This will:
- Add `role` enum column to users table
- Set default role as 'user' for all existing users

### 2. Create Admin User
Run the admin seed script:

```bash
npm run seed:admin
```

This will create the default admin account.

### 3. Create Additional Admins
To create more admin users, use the registration endpoint with role parameter:

```bash
POST /auth/register
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

Form Data:
- name: "Admin Name"
- email: "admin@example.com"
- password: "SecurePassword123!"
- role: "admin"  ‚Üê Add this field
- image: [optional file]
```

**Note:** In production, you should restrict who can create admin accounts!

## Usage Examples

```

### 5. Regular User Trying Admin Action (Forbidden)
```bash

Authorization: Bearer USER_TOKEN
...

Response: 403 Forbidden
{
  "statusCode": 403,
  "message": "Forbidden resource",
  "error": "Forbidden"
}
```

## Testing

### Test Scenario 1: Regular User Access
1. Login as regular user
2. Try to create medicine ‚Üí Should fail (403 Forbidden)
3. View medicines ‚Üí Should succeed
4. View own profile ‚Üí Should succeed

### Test Scenario 2: Admin Access
1. Login as admin
2. Create medicine ‚Üí Should succeed
3. Edit medicine ‚Üí Should succeed
4. Delete medicine ‚Üí Should succeed
5. View all users ‚Üí Should succeed
6. Delete user ‚Üí Should succeed

## Security Notes

### üîí Important Security Considerations

1. **Protect Admin Registration**
   - In production, remove the ability to register as admin via public API
   - Use environment-based admin creation or secure admin panel

2. **Password Security**
   - Admin passwords are hashed using bcrypt
   - Change default admin password immediately

3. **JWT Token Security**
   - Tokens include user role in payload
   - Role is verified on every protected request
   - Use HTTPS in production

4. **Role Validation**
   - All admin endpoints use both `JwtAuthGuard` and `RolesGuard`
   - Role is checked against user's database role
   - Cannot be bypassed by token manipulation

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified/Created

**New Files:**
- `/src/auth/decorators/roles.decorator.ts` - Role decorator
- `/src/auth/guards/roles.guard.ts` - Role-based guard
- `/src/seed-admin.ts` - Admin seed script
- `/src/migrations/xxx-AddRoleToUsers.ts` - Migration

**Modified Files:**
- `/src/users/entities/user.entity.ts` - Added role field
- `/src/users/dto/register.dto.ts` - Added optional role field
- `/src/users/dto/user-response.dto.ts` - Include role in response
- `/src/medicines/medicines.controller.ts` - Added admin guards
- `/src/users/users.controller.ts` - Added admin guards
- `package.json` - Added seed:admin script

### Database Schema

```sql
-- Users table now has role column
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN role users_role_enum DEFAULT 'user' NOT NULL;

-- Enum type
CREATE TYPE users_role_enum AS ENUM ('user', 'admin');
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Forbidden resource" even with admin login
**Solution:** Ensure migrations are run and role field exists in database

### Issue: Cannot create admin user
**Solution:** Check that role enum is properly created in database

### Issue: Regular users can access admin endpoints
**Solution:** Verify both `JwtAuthGuard` and `RolesGuard` are applied to endpoints

## Summary
